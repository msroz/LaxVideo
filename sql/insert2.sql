I was born in upstate New York, but grew up outside Boston in a small town called Wayland. Went to Colgate University where I majored in Environmental Geography, lived on the lacrosse field, and played drums in a couple bands (I was terrible). During my years spent in the throes of academia, I began traveling when I could, first to Venezuela, spent a semester living in South Africa, bought a kidnapper van with no windows ($700!) that took me on a few crazy adventures around the country as well as up to Canada where I worked on a dairy farm for a while.\n\nAs I became inspired by the people, places, and perspectives I was attempting to absorb, I began playing the guitar all the time. I was teaching myself how to play, so it didn\'t sound too pretty back then, but often helped me to sort myself out. After school ended, I headed out to Chicago where I began playing out at open mics and worked as the recess guy (human jungle gym) at an elementary school in the city. Recorded my first album, began traveling around the country playing at coffee shops and book store type places, lived out of my car, didn\'t bathe much, often ate small plants and grubs I would find on the side of the road. (just kidding about that last part)\n\nIn 2002, after spending some time volunteering for the relief effort in Kosovo, I moved back to Boston and began forming the band. We called ourselves the Adam Ezra Group because I\'m a self-absorbed, egomaniac, and threw together a CD that I paid for by doing carpentry for the guy who owned the recording studio. Over the next three years, we\'ve had a pretty fun ride, releasing a second CD, signing a touring deal with Budweiser, and playing with some incredible musicians along the way. \n\nOK, what else? I enjoy playing bridge with my great aunt Florence, wear press-on nails on three fingers of my right hand for guitar picking which people seem to find a little freakish, hate clothes that I have to pay more than $4 to own, live in a small, dank basement room that I built myself, believe Karl Rove is really a Sith lord who, much like Darth Sidious, will one day absolve the senate, take over the galaxy and perhaps even shoot stinging purple stuff out of his fingers. still don\'t bathe too often, think that if I followed my real calling in life I would be the DH for the Red Sox, hope to someday live in a small cabin at the base of Mt. Lafayette in NH, think Frank Herbert is the smartest guy ever, and of course love run-on sentences.','https://vimeo.com/94440169',1280,720,'https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/474312611_100x75.jpg',279,0,0,0,1422460311,1422460311);

I was born in upstate New York, but grew up outside Boston in a small town called Wayland. Went to Colgate University where I majored in Environmental Geography, lived on the lacrosse field, and played drums in a couple bands (I was terrible). During my years spent in the throes of academia, I began traveling when I could, first to Venezuela, spent a semester living in South Africa, bought a kidnapper van with no windows ($700!) that took me on a few crazy adventures around the country as well as up to Canada where I worked on a dairy farm for a while.\n\nAs I became inspired by the people, places, and perspectives I was attempting to absorb, I began playing the guitar all the time. I was teaching myself how to play, so it didn\'t sound too pretty back then, but often helped me to sort myself out. After school ended, I headed out to Chicago where I began playing out at open mics and worked as the recess guy (human jungle gym) at an elementary school in the city. Recorded my first album, began traveling around the country playing at coffee shops and book store type places, lived out of my car, didn\'t bathe much, often ate small plants and grubs I would find on the side of the road. (just kidding about that last part)\n\nIn 2002, after spending some time volunteering for the relief effort in Kosovo, I moved back to Boston and began forming the band. We called ourselves the Adam Ezra Group because I\'m a self-absorbed, egomaniac, and threw together a CD that I paid for by doing carpentry for the guy who owned the recording studio. Over the next three years, we\'ve had a pretty fun ride, releasing a second CD, signing a touring deal with Budweiser, and playing with some incredible musicians along the way. \n\nOK, what else? I enjoy playing bridge with my great aunt Florence, wear press-on nails on three fingers of my right hand for guitar picking which people seem to find a little freakish, hate clothes that I have to pay more than $4 to own, live in a small, dank basement room that I built myself, believe Karl Rove is really a Sith lord who, much like Darth Sidious, will one day absolve the senate, take over the galaxy and perhaps even shoot stinging purple stuff out of his fingers. still don\'t bathe too often, think that if I followed my real calling in life I would be the DH for the Red Sox, hope to someday live in a small cabin at the base of Mt. Lafayette in NH, think Frank Herbert is the smartest guy ever, and of course love run-on sentences.','https://vimeo.com/94254916',1280,720,'https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/474191652_100x75.jpg',160,0,0,0,1422460329,1422460329);

Cecilia’s abilities do not stop at the above, she can also shoot and edit.  Her eye for the story within a story is what makes her craft such an anomaly.\n\nCecilia has produced live sporting events and sports compilation specials for ESPNU, Fox College Sports, and the Untamed Sports Network.  She got her national television debut in 2007 as an associate producer for two football bowl games that aired on ESPNU – the American Heritage Bowl (an HBCU All-Star Game) and the Southern California Bowl (a Southern California High School All-Star Game).  Cecilia continued to produce as Coordinating Producer and Line Producer for the 49th and 50th Annual Orange County All Star Football Game on ESPNU.\n\nCecilia honed her on-camera skills as a reporter for Athletes in Motion Sports Television (AIM) and host for the Football Channel on AIM’s online media network.  With AIM, Cecilia covered a wide variety of sports, including football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, baseball, softball, lacrosse, and even weightlifting.  She was instrumental in the redevelopment of AIM’s online media network, and continues to manage the entire network through all phases of production.\n\nAn additional venture for Cecilia was Co-Host and Online Media Network Manager for Black Diamond University Television (BDU TV), a personal growth and development network.   As Co-Host, Cecilia travelled all over the world – to the Indy 500 in Indianapolis, Salt Lake City, Utah, Saipan, and South Korea – covering the human interest stories of successful entrepreneurs and reporting on their business tips and tricks. In addition to being Co-Host, Cecilia oversaw various platforms of development for the online media network, including live broadcasts from South Korea.\n\nOriginally from Seattle, Washington, Cecilia moved to Southern California in 2003 to pursue her career in television.  She is an alumna of Chapman University in Orange, California, where she graduated Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Television and Broadcast Journalism, with a minor in Political Science.  During her senior year at Chapman University, she produced a documentary (eat! sleep? bikes!), which won the “Cecil Award” for Best Documentary.   eat! sleep? bikes! was showcased nationally and internationally in the Bicycle Film Festival.\n\nCecilia’s passion is television and telling the story of those that need to be heard. Through a variety of different avenues, Cecilia has found many of the same important qualities in each of her stories – inspiration, motivation, and determination.\n\nFor more information, visit www.CeciliaCuaresma.com','https://vimeo.com/18978462',1280,720,'https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/119886760_100x75.jpg',164,0,0,0,1422460545,1422460545);
