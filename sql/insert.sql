Video was shot at 24 Mbs, The challenges are low light as a night game, fast action, small ball and a large playing surface.  The Canon XA10 did well with the low light and the optical stabilization worked well.  Occasionally the auto focus had to hunt, but this is not uncommon in trying to follow sports.  At maximum zoom and low light there was a hint of vignetting.   Overall, the camera met the challenges.\nThe CAL Bears host the Dominican Penguins in a fall ball game as a preview to the 2012 season.  Dominican is in their third year as a NCAA D2 team, one of only three NCAA lacrosse programs on the west coast.   The Penguins have never beaten Cal, who plays in the MCLA,  and this provides some extra motivation for their seniors.  After a mostly defensive first half, Dominican has a huge third quarter and cruises to a 13-5 win.','https://vimeo.com/30561567',1280,720,'https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/205345647_100x75.jpg',172,0,0,0,1422375112,1422375112);

Fifteen students, led by Falk College sport management professor of practice Dennis Deninger, researched this question in great detail as part of SPM 300—The History of Sport, which debuted during the Fall 2012 semester. Their research is the basis for a one-hour documentary entitled, “America’s First Sport,” set to premiere in Syracuse on April 22. The documentary will be narrated by ESPN commentator and Newhouse alumnus, Mike Tirico ’88, who serves on the Sport Management and Newhouse School Advisory Boards. The documentary will serve as the centerpiece of an academic symposium on lacrosse’s role in the culture of Central New York co-sponsored by the Falk College and S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications.\n\nEach semester, SPM 300 will pinpoint a single topic for students to conduct original research and interviews, use primary sources, and explore multiple facets of the subject.  Lacrosse was selected as the subject for the course’s inaugural year because of its ancient origins and cultural connections in Central New York. This past fall, Deninger, who is also the director of the Newhouse Sports Communications graduate program, required students to look at the origins of organized sport in the United States, answering such questions as, how has sport impacted American society, how does it play a cultural role, and what does the history and current state of American sports foreshadow for the future?  Each student completed a final research project on lacrosse entitled, America\'s First Sport.\n\nFive students who enrolled in the course during Fall 2012 are continuing the independent study this spring, including undergraduate students from the Falk College, Newhouse School, and the College of Visual and Performing Arts. They have done research on amateur and professional lacrosse to support 45 interviews done by professor Deninger since February.  These include in-depth discussions with Native American leaders, current and legendary players and coaches, presidents of the Federation of International Lacrosse and U.S. Lacrosse, the commissioner of Major League Lacrosse, media from ESPN and Inside Lacrosse Magazine and lacrosse historians. Onondaga Nation Chief Irving Powless, current Onondaga Community College players, including All-World Under-19 goalkeeper, Warren Hill, and SU coaches Roy Simmons Jr., Gary Gait and John Desko are among those featured in the documentary.\n\nStudents will play key roles in planning the symposium and are currently identifying topics to be placed before the panel and related lines of questioning.  “It is a unique learning opportunity for our sport management students to see the work they have done become something as tangible as a documentary film,” said Michael D. Veley, director and chair, Department of Sport Management. “In most classes, students hand in a paper and after they receive their grade, the process ends,” said Deninger.  “But in our History of Sport class, the student’s work will become part of a legacy of research that will help define the Falk College and its Sport Management Department for years to come.”  For more information about the premiere, contact the Department of Sport Management at (315) 443-9881.\n\nRead an article on the documentary by Major League Lacrosse:\nhttp://www.majorleaguelacrosse.com/news/6858/americas-first-sport-documentary-visits-mll-offices/\n\nCredits:\nWritten & Directed by Dennis Deninger\nProducer,  John Craddock\nDirector of Photography, Michael Barletta\nEdited by  Holly Rodricks\n\nCopyright Syracuse University 2013','https://vimeo.com/61378813',1920,1080,'https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/434805089_100x75.jpg',180,0,0,0,1422375148,1422375148);

The purpose of the first test was to check out the limits of shooting with Dual Pixel CMOS Autofocus in a variety of scenarios and then share the results at the workshop. The footage includes both graded MXF and ungraded ProRes 422 sequences. I recorded the on-screen displays to the ProRes footage to show the AF working and mixed that in occasionally with the graded MXF footage. Additionally, since Dual Pixel AF does not  work in Slow and Fast Motion mode in the C300, I wanted to test the 59.94p (1280x720) alternative.\n\nIn the second test, I took the cameras to East Haven, CT, to shoot a lighthouse for a high ISO sensor sensitivity test. The scenario I made up for the nighttime shoot was: \"What if a film crew got stuck in traffic and arrived at location late -- way after dark -- to shoot a \'must have\' shot for an urgent promo insert? Could you still make the shot?\" Recording with a C100 and Atomos Ninja 2, the ProRes test footage includes a control shot from magic hour ungraded and also graded as intended for the promo, and then a series of night time shots made in total darkness from ISO 320 to ISO 80,000. You can check out the high ISO footage graded and ungraded, and with and without noise reduction applied. As a final sequence, I took the shot I made in total darkness at ISO 80,000, applied noise reduction (Red Giant Denoiser II), and then color graded it to look like the control shot made at magic hour. \n\nI think you\'ll find the results of both tests worth watching.\n\nThanks to:\nWill Ramsey\nKim Anderson\nLighthouse Park, East Haven, CT\nKessler Crane\nAtomos\nmusic by longzijun --http://longzijun.wordpress.com','https://vimeo.com/105447356',1280,720,'https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/499171221_100x75.jpg',1083,0,0,0,1422375148,1422375148);

Partridge. Captain Partridge believed in the \"American System of Education,\" a traditional liberal arts curriculum with instruction in civil engineering and military science. After leaving West Point because of congressional disapproval of his system, he returned to his native state of Vermont to create the American Literary, Scientific and Military Academy. Captain Partridge, in founding his academy, rebelled against the reforms of Sylvanus Thayer to prevent the rise of what he saw as the greatest threat to the security of the young republic: a professional officer class. He believed that a well-trained militia was an urgent necessity and developed the American system around that idea. His academy became the inspiration for a number of military colleges throughout the nation, including both the Virginia Military Institute and The Citadel, and later the land grant colleges created through the Morrill Act of 1862.[4]\nPartridge\'s educational beliefs were considered radical at the time, and this led to his conflicting views with the federal government while he was the superintendent of West Point. Upon creation of his own school, he immediately incorporated classes of agriculture and modern languages in addition to the sciences, liberal arts, and various military subjects. Field exercises, for which Partridge borrowed cannon and muskets from the federal and state governments, supplemented classroom instruction and added an element of realism to the college’s program of well-rounded military education.\nPartridge founded six other military institutions during his quest to reform the fledgling United States military. They were the Virginia Literary, Scientific and Military Academy at Portsmouth, Virginia (1839–1846), Pennsylvania Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy at Bristol, Pennsylvania (1842–1845), Pennsylvania Military Institute at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania (1845–1848), Wilmington Literary, Scientific and Military Academy at Wilmington, Delaware (1846–1848), the Scientific and Military Collegiate Institute at Reading, Pennsylvania (1850–1854), Gymnasium and Military Institute at Pembroke, New Hampshire (1850–1853) and the National Scientific and Military Academy at Brandywine Springs, Delaware (1853).[5]\n[edit]Fire and hardship: Norwich in the 19th century\nIn 1825 the academy moved to Middletown, Connecticut, to provide better naval training to the school\'s growing corps of cadets. In 1829, the state of Connecticut declined to grant Captain Partridge a charter and he moved the school back to Norwich (the Middletown campus became Wesleyan University in 1831). Beginning in 1826, the college offered the first program of courses in civil engineering in the US. In 1834 Vermont granted a charter and recognized the institution as Norwich University. During the 1856 academic year, the first chapter of the Theta Chi Fraternity was founded by cadets Frederick Norton Freeman and Arthur Chase. With the beginning of the Civil War in 1861, Norwich cadets served as instructors of the state militias throughout the Northeast and the entire class of 1862 enlisted upon its graduation. Norwich turned out hundreds of officers and soldiers who served with the federal armies in the American Civil War, including four recipients of the Medal of Honor. One graduate led a corps, seven more headed divisions, 21 commanded brigades, 38 led regiments, and various alumni served in 131 different regimental organizations. In addition, these men were eyewitnesses to some of the war\'s most dramatic events, including the bloodiest day of the conflict at Antietam, the attack up Marye\'s Heights at Fredericksburg, and the repulse of Pickett\'s Charge at Gettysburg. Seven hundred and fifty Norwich men served in the Civil War, of whom sixty fought for the Confederacy.[6] Because of the university\'s participation in the struggle, the number of students dwindled to seven in the class of 1864 alone.\nThe Confederate raid on St. Albans, Vermont precipitated fear that Newport, Vermont was an imminent target. The corps quickly boarded an express train for Newport, the same day, October 19, 1864, to the great relief of the inhabitants.\nAfter a catastrophic fire in 1866 which devastated the entire campus, the town of Northfield welcomed the struggling school. The Civil War, the fire, and the uncertainty regarding the continuation of the University seriously lowered the attendance, and the school opened in the fall of 1866 with only 19 students. The 1870s and 1880s saw many financially turbulent times for the institution and the renaming of the school to Lewis College in 1880. In 1881 the student body was reduced to only a dozen men. Later, by 1884, the Vermont Legislature had the name of the school changed back to Norwich. In 1898 the university was designated as the Military College of the State of Vermont.\n[edit]War and expansion: Norwich in the 20th century\nAs part of the Vermont National Guard, the school\'s Corps of Cadets was mobilized as a squadron of cavalry in the First Vermont Regiment to assist in General John J. Pershing\'s Mexican Expedition. This greatly disrupted the academic year and in 1916 the War Department designated Norwich as the first site for a Senior ROTC cavalry unit; also in 1916, the first African-American, Harold \"Doc\" Martin (NU 1920), matriculated. Classes graduated early for both the First and Second World Wars and many Norwich-made officers saw service in all theaters of both conflicts. Professional education offered at Norwich also changed and adapted with the advance of technology. Military flight training began in 1939 and from 1946 to 1947, horse cavalry was completely phased out in favor of armored cavalry.\nGraduates returning from European and Pacific fields of battle found a university very different from the one they had left behind. From the late 1940s to the 1960s, Norwich was greatly expanded and added a number of new opportunities. In 1947, the Army Department created a new program uniquely suited to Vermont\'s harsh climate: a mountain and cold weather warfare unit. Air Force and Navy ROTC programs were established in 1972 and 1984 respectively. During the 1974 school year, the university admitted women into the Corps of Cadets, two years before the federal service academies. Although unpopular at the time, Norwich University began a social trend that would move the country closer in gender equality. The 1972 merger and 1993 integration with Vermont College added two groups to \"the Hill,\" women and civilian students. Norwich later sold its Vermont College campus and non-traditional degree programs to the Union Institute and University in 2001.[7] Vermont College\'s arts programs were spun off as the once again independent Vermont College of Fine Arts in 2008.\n[edit]Hazing\nIn the nineteenth century, hazing of undergraduates by upper classmen was normal in all military schools and many non-military ones as well. Hazing diminished in the early 20th century. By the late 20th century, it became not only counter to university rules but illegal as well. Nevertheless, there have been several instances of hazing in 1990, 1995.[8]\n[edit]Campus\n\n[edit]Academic buildings\n[edit]Ainsworth Hall\nIn 1910 Ainsworth Hall was constructed for the United States Weather Bureau as its central Vermont station. Later returned to the university in 1948, it served as the Administrative Headquarters of the campus. By 1955, growth of the University forced the relocation of the Administration back up the hill to Dewey Hall. When also in 1955 construction began on Webb Hall to the immediate west of the building, the infirmary moved into the now empty structure. Due to expansion of the university in the 1960s and 1970s the building was converted into the home of the Division of Social Sciences. The building is named for Mrs. Laura Ainsworth, widow of Captain James E. Ainsworth (NU 1853), who in 1915 worked to bring an infirmary to campus.\n[edit]Chaplin Hall\nChaplin Hall, originally Carnegie Hall, was built in 1907. The School of Architecture & Art is located there. Paid for by Andrew Carnegie, the building served as the university\'s library until 1993 with the construction of Kreitzberg Library. When the library was renovated in 1952, from the contributions of trustee Henry P. Chaplin, it was rededicated as the Henry Prescott Chaplin Memorial Library. Until 1941 and the addition of Partridge Hall to the growing campus, Chaplin Hall also provided the classrooms and offices for the Department of Electrical Engineering.\n[edit]Communications Building\nThis building, on the site of the first building in Center Northfield, contains the offices and classrooms of the Communications Department. The offices for the Guidon and the studios for both the university\'s radio station WNUB-FM are also located in this building. The building was purchased by the university in 1973 and restored in 1988.\n[edit]Dewey Hall\nNamed for Admiral of the Navy George Dewey (NU 1852-1854), and completed in 1902, Dewey Hall is one of the oldest buildings in the Northfield campus. It was originally two stories high with the lower floor occupied by offices of the university\'s administration, the library and museum. Office space for trustees and faculty, a chapel with a seating of five hundred and the United States Weather Bureau were located on the second floor. With the departure of the Weather Bureau in 1909 and the completion of the then new Carnegie Library in 1907 the Hall was primarily used by the Military Department. In October 1925 a fire gutted the building which led to its reconstruction as a three story structure. Dewey Hall currently houses the Division of Business & Management and a computer lab.\n[edit]Hollis House\nHollis House is today the location of a number of classrooms and offices of the Division of Humanities. Built in 1852, the building was until 1909 the house of a number of prominent residents of Northfield. When sold that year to the university, it became part of the US Weather Bureau\'s station collocated on campus. The building was later named for David B. \"Dixie\" Hollis (NU 1922) who upon his death in 1993 gave what was then the largest donation in the university\'s history: $7 million.\n[edit]Engineering, Math and Science Complex\nThe Engineering, Math and Science Complex houses the David Crawford School of Engineering as well as the departments of Geology, Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Mathematics and Sports Medicine. Currently under construction is an addition of Nursing in the bottom floor of the building. The complex is composed of six buildings: Juckett, Partridge and Tompkins Halls; the Science Building, Bartolleto Hall and the Cabot Annex. The complex was completed in 1997 and replaced a previous set of 1940s- and 1950s-era facilities. The Engineering, Math and Science Complex also contains the university\'s Computer Services office and the majority of the campus\' independent computer labs.\n[edit]Kreitzberg Library\nKreitzberg Library is named in recognition of Barbara and Chairman of the Board of Trustees Fred Kreitzberg (NU 1957).[9] The library has a catalogue of more than 240,000 books, about 45,000 electronic journals, and a collection of federal government publications. The Norwich University Archives and Special Collections houses rare books and unique source materials relating to military history, the history of Vermont, and the history of the university. The 58,000-square-foot (5,400 m2) library was designed by Perry, Dean, Rogers & Partners and was completed in 1993 at a cost of $8.1 million.\n\n\nKreitzberg Library\n[edit]Webb Hall\nWebb Hall was completed in 1960 and originally housed the English, Modern Languages, Social Sciences, Business Administration and the Psychology and Education departments. Currently, the Division of Humanities, Nursing Department and Education program are located in this building. Twenty one classrooms, three seminar rooms and a computer lab are available.\nDole Auditorium, which can seat over four hundred people, is also located in Webb Hall. The building is named after J. Watson Webb, a Norwich trustee and world class polo player. The auditorium honors Charles Dole (NU 1869), who served in his career at the university as an instructor in Mathematics and Latin, a professor of history and rhetoric, the commandant of cadets and acting president of the university from 1895 to 1896.\n[edit]Residence halls and Cadet barracks\nHawkins Hall — Named for General Hawkins, a colonel in the Civil War and later New York State Congressman.

In addition, it has basketball and racquetball courts and the equipment and athletic training rooms for the university\'s varsity and intramural teams. The Athletic Hall of Fame is also located in Andrews Hall. The facility honors trustee Paul R. Andrews (NU 1930).\nKreitzberg Arena\nKreitzberg Arena is home to the men’s and women’s varsity ice hockey teams, as well as the school’s club team.\n\n\nKreitzberg thumb\nPlumley Armory\nThe armory, built in 1928, is named to honor a notable 1896 graduate of the university, Charles A. Plumley. Plumley served as the president of the university from 1930 to 1934 when he was elected to Congress as Vermont\'s sole representative from 1934 to 1951. The main floor of the building provides seating space for 4,000 in an area as large as three basketball courts. There is an elevated running track as well as locker rooms, training rooms, and Navy ROTC offices in the basement. Connected to the armory is Goodyear Pool.

Recorded on the memorial, by year of death, are the names of alumni, faculty, staff, and friends of Norwich University that have made a \"significant contribution\" to the university.\nHarmon Hall & Wise Campus Center\nHarmon Hall opened in 1955 and later enlarged in 1958. Since then, it has served as the focal point for student life and activities. The campus mess hall, bookstore, post office, and The Mill (a snack bar open to upperclassmen and civilian freshmen) are located on the lower two floors. The Foreign Student Office, Student Activities, Yearbook Office, Music Program offices, a game room, and a lounge were located on the top floor. This floor originally housed the departments of English, History, and Modern Languages until they were moved to Webb Hall in 1960. Harmon Hall was renovated in 2007. The addition onto Harmon Hall is named the Wise Campus Center.\n\n\nWcc\nJackman Hall\nNorwich University moved to Northfield from Norwich, Vermont, in 1866 when the South Barracks at the older location were destroyed by fire. Old Jackman Hall was the first building to be constructed at the new central Vermont site. The building was erected in 1868, and named Jackman Hall in 1907 to honor Brigadier General Alonzo Jackman (NU 1836) a faculty member, creator of the trans-Atlantic telegraph cable system and commander of the Vermont Brigade during the Civil War. From its construction till 1905 the building served as housing for cadets. In the mid-1950s Jackman Hall was extensively remodeled and modernized, however, it became apparent that the almost century-old barracks were too costly to maintain. It was decided that rather than pay for near continual upkeep to build a new hall on the same site. As many newer barracks had been built since its original construction it was decided that the new Jackman Hall would serve as the primary administration building. Currently the Army and Air Force ROTC departments are housed in Jackman, as well.\nWhite Chapel\nConstructed by a gift from Eugene L. White (NU 1914), a trustee, the chapel was completed in 1941. Originally designed as a multi-purpose building, then White Hall has served as a mess hall with a dining room, lunch room, kitchen, a college store and a recreational room. White Hall was converted to the university\'s first single-purpose chapel after Harmon Hall was opened in 1955. There are two bronze plaques on the walls that honor the Norwich war dead. Weekly services include Catholic Mass on Wednesday and Sunday, non-denominational service on Sunday, and Islamic prayer on Friday.\nSullivan Museum and History Center\nOne of the newer buildings on the campus, the Sullivan Museum was opened January 22, 2007. The building is named after General Gordon R. Sullivan (ret.), Norwich class of 1959 and former U.S. Army Chief of Staff. The Sullivan Museum houses state of the art conservation, storage, and display facilities for the wide variety of Norwich University artifacts and memorabilia. Items currently displayed cover a wide spectrum of Norwich history, including uniforms worn by Alden Partridge and Alonzo Jackman to pieces from more recent history.\n\n\nSullivan Museum\n\n[edit]Students and organization\n\nThe university has approximately a total of 3,400 students, 2,100 undergraduate students/ 1300 graduate students, 112 full-time faculty (approximately 80% hold a doctorate), and a fluctuating number of adjunct professors. The student/faculty ratio is 14:1 and a male/female ratio is 7:1. The freshman retention rate is 80%. The student body comprises students from over 45 different states and 20 countries.\nAs of 2011, 72.9 percent of full-time undergraduates receive some kind of need-based financial aid and the average need-based scholarship or grant award is $18,150.\nThe university offers a number of student services including nonremedial tutoring, placement service, health service, and health insurance. Norwich University also offers campus safety and security services like 24-hour foot and vehicle patrols, 24-hour emergency telephones, and lighted pathways/sidewalks. 42% of students have cars on campus and 83% of students live on campus. Alcohol is not permitted for students of legal age at Norwich University with exception of Partridge’s Pub. More than 90% are involved in activities outside the classroom.\nNorwich University has two very different on-campus resident programs: the Corps of Cadets and the traditional student body.\n[edit]Corps of Cadets\nCadet officers and non-commissioned officers command the Corps of Cadets. As leaders, they are responsible for the day-to-day administration, operation, training and discipline of the Corps. Norwich is one of several Senior Military Colleges in the country whose cadets are entrusted with that authority. The Corps is structured as a regiment commanded by a Cadet Colonel (C/COL) with five battalions each commanded by a Cadet Lieutenant Colonel (C/LTC). 1st, 2nd, and Provisional Battalions are composed of Companies of upperclassmen commanded by a Cadet Captain with two platoons per Company. 3rd and 4th Battalion are the freshman training battalions and are composed of 3 Companies of 3 platoons each.\nThis structure was put in place for the 2009-2010 school year, replacing the more traditional original company system. Prior to the 2009-2010 school year companies consisted of one upperclassmen platoon and one freshmen platoon. Each platoon consisted of three squads each led by a cadet Staff Sergeant. Interaction between the upper-class cadets and freshmen cadets was common, leading to[clarification needed] original companies.\nAn Original Company is the company that a cadet belongs to as a freshmen. Upper-class cadets who were of an original company their freshman year would guide and mentor the incoming freshman cadets who were in that company. With in the original companies was an unofficial rank structure, which ensured which handled disputes within the companies, as well as enforcing each companies\' values. These shadow chains of command ran afoul with the administration of the school,[citation needed] in part leading to the demise of the original company system.\nThe companies in the original company system included, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot, Golf, Hotel, India, Kilo, Band, Drill Company, Cavalry Troop and Artillery. The companies Alpha through Kilo were known as line companies, and were part of Battalions 1,2 and 3. Band, Drill Company, Calvary Troop and Artillery were called provisional companies and placed in Provisional Battalion.[citation needed]\nNew Corps structure:\n1st Battalion	2nd Battalion	3rd Battalion	4th Battalion	Provisional Battalion\nAlpha	Delta	Cadet Training Company 10-1 (CTC 1)	Cadet Training Company 10-4 (CTC 4)	Regimental Band [10]\nBravo	Echo	Cadet Training Company 10-2 (CTC 2)	Cadet Training Company 10-5 (CTC 5)	Drill[11]\nCharlie	Foxtrot	Cadet Training Company 10-3 (CTC 3)	Cadet Training Company 10-6 (CTC 6)	Cavalry Troop[12]\nArtillery[13]\n\n\nFormation march\nNorwich University Corps of Cadets rank insignia follows West Point with the use of chevrons to show all cadet ranks in lieu of chevrons, disks & lozenges. As of the 2010 academic year, the rank structure has changed. Juniors and seniors are no longer permitted the rank of Sergeant, but rather default to the rank of Private if they hold no responsibilities in the Corps of Cadets. Likewise, sophomores no longer default to the rank of Corporal unless they hold some sort of responsibility.\nRanks are as follows:\nFreshman: Recruit, Private\nSophomore: Private, Corporal\nJunior: Private, Staff Sergeant, Sergeant First Class, Master Sergeant, First Sergeant, Sergeant Major, Command Sergeant Major\nSenior: Private, Command Sergeant Major, 2nd Lieutenant, 1st Lieutenant, Captain, Major, Lieutenant Colonel, Colonel\nSpecial Units\nThe college has several ROTC units that are federally supervised. The Army Reserve Officers\' Training Corps (AROTC) detachment contains the Norwich University Rangers,[14] and the Mountain Cold Weather Company. The Rangers are AROTC-specific while the Mountain Cold Weather Company[15] is open to all Corps Cadets. The AFROTC detachment sponsors the Air Force Special Operations Unit. The NROTC detachment sponsors a chapter of the Semper Fidelis Society.\n[edit]Academics\n\nNorwich has 29 majors across six academic divisions with the most popular major being Criminal Justice.[citation needed]\n[edit]Graduate Program\nThe School of Graduate and Continuing Studies oversees the university\'s graduate programs. The majority of the graduate programs are conducted on a distance learning platform. The university offers accredited and highly recognized programs in a range of fields including diplomacy, military history, business administration, civil engineering, justice administration, public administration, business continuity, information assurance, nursing, and organizational leadership, plus a certificate in teaching and learning.[16] The School of Graduate Studies became The School of Graduate and Continuing Studies on June 1, 2010.[17]\nNorwich offers online graduate programs, including a 5-year Master of Architecture program, and, since 2001, a National Security Agency-sponsored Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education.[18]\nNorwich offers master\'s degrees in disciplines including diplomacy, military history, business administration, civil engineering, justice administration, public administration, business continuity, information assurance, nursing, and organizational leadership, plus a certificate in teaching and learning.[citation needed]\n\n[edit]Athletics\n\n\n\nNorwich cadet logo\nNorwich offers 18 varsity sports, 3 club sports and intramurals. The Cadets compete at the NCAA Division III level and are affiliated in one of four conferences, mainly the Great Northeast Athletic Conference (GNAC). There are 18 varsity sports and 3 club sports at Norwich University. The Cadets participate in baseball, basketball, cross country, football, rugby, soccer, lacrosse, and more. In recent years, Norwich teams have been regularly found in the national rankings, won conference titles, and won four national championships in ice hockey.\nMen\'s ice hockey is nationally ranked and celebrated its 100th season in 2009-10. The program has won ECAC East hockey championships in the regular season every year from 1998–2008.[19] Won the NCAA Division III title in 2000, 2003 and most recently won the 2010 NCAA Division III title, defeating St. Norbert College 2-1 in double overtime.[20] Coach Mike McShane, who led Norwich University to three NCAA Division III Men’s Ice Hockey National Championships, has been named Men’s Division III Ice Hockey Coach of the Year four times, tying Middlebury’s Coach Bill Beaney for the most such awards.[citation needed]\nWomen\'s ice hockey is nationally ranked and skated their way to their first Frozen Four bid in 2010 in the NCAA Division III Championship Game. In 2011 they won the programs first NCAA Division III National Title with a win over RIT. Women’s ice hockey coach Mark Bolding became just the third coach in Division III history to win the American Hockey Coaches Association (AHCA) D-III Coach of the Year award in consecutive years (2010-2011).[citation needed]\nMen\'s rugby began competition in 1970. The team competes in the Division II of the New England Rugby Football Union (NERFU). After competing as a club team since they began intercollegiate play, in 2008 the program had officially gained varsity status.\nWomen\'s lacrosse program gained varsity status in 2008. In 2010 they had their first appearance in the NCAA tournament field.\nMen\'s basketball returned to the NCAA Tournament in 2006\nWoman\'s basketball in 2010 they advanced to the GNAC championship game and the ECAC Division III New England Women’s Basketball Tournament.\nMen\'s and Women\'s soccer\nRifle team won the national intercollegiate rifle championship in 1916 [21] and 1920.[22]\n[edit]Notable alumni\n\n[edit]Military\n138 graduates of Norwich University have served as general officers in the U.S. armed forces: 102 Army generals, 11 Air Force generals, 9 Marine Corps generals, and 16 Navy admirals. 26 graduates served as generals in foreign armies: 9 Royal Thai Army general, 1 Royal Thai Air Force general, and 16 Republic of China Army generals.[citation needed]\nAmong the notable military graduates and former students of Norwich are:\nRear Admiral Hiram Paulding (class of 1822) — Commander of the Navy\'s Home Squadron, 1856–1858; Commandant of the New York Navy Yard, 1861-1865.

Tyler\'s other vimeo projects can be seen at vimeo.com/tmlacross and his photography can be seen at flickr.com/tmlacross.\n\nFor the video, Tyler used a Nikon D90 for the video and edited with Final Cut Pro. My friend Chandler Wrenn and Tyler LaCross jointly played the \"hewers\" of wood, and I played the female character in the video.\n\nI first became interested in Denise Levertov(1923-1997) because of her nature imagery. In this poem, she confronts the nature vs. culture binary and definitely allows nature to win. The defiant craftsman fighting the materialism of consumer culture becomes the one who has this driving life force pushing that one beyond whatever ends. Levertov uses the word \"it\" for the life force, the mystery behind the poem. She leaves it ambiguous so readers create their own interpretation. It could also be taken in a spiritual sense.\n\nWhen making the film, Tyler and I ran into a few issues with taking the poem from paper to screen. While Tyler has an amazing artistic eye, I also had my own interpretation of the poem. However, working together from the two perspectives (film and poetry) worked out pretty well after discussions over how interpretation affects film-making. My interpretation was based on many happenings in Levertov’s life around the time she wrote the poem as well as her beliefs about craftsmanship and the importance of punctuation.\n\n','https://vimeo.com/15549763',1280,720,'https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/93866170_100x75.jpg',117,0,0,0,1422375166,1422375166);

He took a break from playing video games at a friend’s house, walked home, picked up his father’s gun and shot his entire family as they slept.\n\nDead were his father Tom, mother Sylvia, and little brothers Gregory 10 years old and Benjamin eight.   Worse yet, Nicholas confessed to crime but gave little explanation or motive other than the fact that his father wouldn’t let him use the family car to attend a party.  \n\nBut Nicholas was not alone in his savagery.\n\nSeveral weeks later just miles from the Browning residence another promising young man inexplicably turned to murder.  A 17-year old star athlete Lewin Powell had been fighting with his mother over his flagging grades.,  But at some point in the dispute Powell  picked up a bat and beat his mother to death.  \n\nBut he wasn’t done.  \n\nThe 17 year old Lewin Powell hid his mother’s corpse in a bedroom and waited for his father to return from work.  The elder Powell fell asleep on the couch, where his son attacked him with the same bat, fracturing his father’s skull in two places before the bewildered parent could subdue his murderous son.\n\nIt’s a case that confounds the normal explanations for violent crime. Neither boys came from troubled homes or suffered from mental illness.  In fact, they were leading exemplary lives.  \n\nWhich is I why I decided these crimes were worth exploring in depth in our continuing televisual dialog on crime called “Why Do We Kill?” In this episode we look at the influence of the simulacra upon our psyches and its potential influence on criminality. Specifically, how our deepening immersion in a world of illusion and symbolism affects or behaviors and may limit our ability to be empathetic.   \n\nIf you want to read more about the topic of why people chose to kill, click on the links below to the books written by the two former Baltimore  homicide detectives who appear in this episode.\n\n\"You Can\'t Stop Murder: Truths about Policing in Baltimore and Beyond\"\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/You-Cant-Stop-Murder-Baltimore/dp/1491009772/ref=pd_sim_b_1\n\n\n\"Why Do We Kill?: The Pathology of Murder in Baltimore\"\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Why-Do-Kill-Pathology-Baltimore/dp/1463534809/ref=pd_sim_sbs_b_1','https://vimeo.com/77862123',1280,720,'https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/453140418_100x75.jpg',1140,0,0,0,1422375166,1422375166);

The event not only offers the best of local and regional music, but an interactive and educational experience to attendees of all ages. This year’s programming features 50+ bands, comedy and theatrical performances, literary readings and book signings, Eco and Children’s Villages, film screenings, gourmet food trucks, beer gardens, street art, and a variety of craft vendors. Initial promotional partners include Brand X, Origami Vinyl, Buzz Bands LA, Spaceland Productions, INDIGENOUS, and Two Rabbits Studios.\n\nLAAAA is a non-profit organization created by Festival Director, Jack Martinez, and Community Director, Charles Renn, promoting the importance of a life long engagement with arts and athletics. Apart from showing attendees a great time, LAAAA envisioned the event’s direct impact on the community and developed a commitment to local charities and the environment. They forged partnerships with local organizations and made charitable donations to 826LA, Hollywood Sunset Free Clinic, Kill Radio and Hollywood Arts Council. This year’s proceeds will benefit programs including lacrosse, graffiti art, music, writing and publishing, healthy living, and sustainability. “We’re excited to support these great causes,” says Martinez, “because that’s what Silver Lake is all about.”\n\nExpanding upon the success of last year’s environmental initiatives, Silver Lake Jubilee will work with Sustain LA to build sustainability into every aspect of the festival including implementing a zero waste program, the use of alternative energy power sources, and banning Styrofoam, single‐use plastic bags, and plastic water bottles. In 2010, the event saved 30,000 single-use plastic bottles, contributing to an 80% landfill diversion rate.\n\nevents@silverlakejubilee.com / 323-362-6650\n\nIf you\'re interested in getting involved, covering the event, or have other press inquiries, contact Brooke Burt: brooke@indigenouspromotions.com','https://vimeo.com/user6179624/silverlakejubileepromo',1280,720,'https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/131757325_100x75.jpg',56,0,0,0,1422375166,1422375166);

When he and and his Republican allies in the legislature turned their backs on their constituents and the 120,000 protestors at their doors, we put down our signs.\n\nAnd we picked up clipboards, gathering recall petition signatures against the Republican senators who had willfully chosen to ignore the voices of their own constituents. Because Sen. Moulton is not yet eligible for recall, we traveled to neighboring senate districts to gather signatures in LaCrosse and Menomonie against senators Kapanke and Harsdorf. Most weekends, over 100 of our members were active, netting roughly 1000 signatures each cold Saturday.\n\nWhen the petitions were filed, we remained engaged, protesting the Governor at his fishing opener in our own backyard, Lake Wissota, and networking with other local activists at events like Bob Fest North. \n\nWhen candidates Moore and Schilling stepped forward, we worked hard to reach voters with their messages. We walked in parades, canvassed, and phone-banked every week this summer, and helped the candidates emerge victorious from primary challenges by \"fake\" Democrats. \n\nThis is our story, in pictures.

It\'s absolutely dripping with fake ultra-patriotism - think of John Williams\' score for Saving Private Ryan but pumped up on steroids - and it perfectly captures the comedic tone the Prophets are going for here.\nAn extremely proud American (Gil Damon) suffering from osteoporosis goes out to the local ballpark to watch some kids play a game of baseball. He just about weeps at the apple-pie wholesomeness of it all as he recounts how baseball is the only original American sport. He notes that Lacrosse was stolen from \"the Injuns\" and football is \"just a gay version of rugby.\" His sentimental views come up against some harsh realities when he gets beaned in the head by a baseball and robbed.\nThe man is under the mistaken belief that Abner Doubleday invented the game. This myth has been debunked by many sports historians, but of course the Minor Prophets know that. That\'s why they make great movies.\nDamon provides a hilarious voiceover that sounds like those old Pepperidge Farm commercials. You\'ll fall out of your chair laughing when he talks about savoring \"the smell of the hot nuts and the rosin bags.\" Director Derek Frey cleverly splices in such symbols of American freedom as the bald eagle and Hulk Hogan.
